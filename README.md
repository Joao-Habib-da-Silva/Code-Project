Writing the beggining of this project i thought that the media querys will be the most confusing part, so i decided to write this part after some parts of the site.
Now i will think about how can i do my design of courses, i was thinking about a square using a div and then this square will have a description, a image and a button to open the course, with all the contents to study about the language in the area
